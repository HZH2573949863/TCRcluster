# TCRcluster
TCRcluster is a tool used for calculating TCR CDR3 distances and cluster the TCR CDR3 sequences based on corresponding peptide sequences.

The aim of TCRcluster project is to design an algorithm to calculate the T cell receptors distance using the TCR-epitope pairs data and then cluster the TCR CDRH3 sequences. After mapping CDR3 sequences in different clusters with antigen species, the correlation between CDR3 motifs and T cell binding antigens can be concluded. The realization of this project is essential for the analysis of T cell reactions and the clinical diagnosis of pathogens in patients by detecting the T cell CDR3 sequences.
